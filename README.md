The purpose of the project was to familiarize myself with <b>Domain Driven Design (DDD)</b> programming.

I refer you to P. Louys book (<b>"Professional PHP - Building maintainable and secure applications"</b>, 2006) for the details.

The goal was to program a small social news website, using a DDD approach.

DDD makes use of a layered architecture composed of:

<b>(1) The Presentation Layer</b>

<b>(2) The Application Layer</b>

<b>(3) The Domain Layer</b>

<b>(4) The Infrastructure Layer</b>

The project touches on the following topics:

- Front Controller
- Bootstrapping
- Dependency Injection
- Templating and Cross-site Scripting
- Application Layer
- Infrastructure Layer
- Cross-site Request Forgery
- SQL Injection
- Registration
- Authentication
- Authorization

Remarks : 

- project designed for php 7.1 or above

- Error in the book (page 195 : file src/Framework/Rbac/CurrentUserFactory.php is not used anywhere)
